## Library vs. Framework

__Library__:

* A set of tools to reduce overhead and improve application consistency by providing reusable pieces of code.
* A library provides useful tools for a specific purpose (functions, helper libs) so you can build your app your way.

__Framework__:

* A **more opinionated** set of tools to reduce overhead and improve application consistency by providing reusable pieces of code.
* Inversion of control. Frameworks specify how you should write your app.

## MVC, MVVM, MVP, MVW, MOVE? WTF?

* Quite a few different patterns being used in client side JS.
* Most are based off of MVC in some fashion.
* They are all really based on the [Observer Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).
